Processed data used in our experiment. 
Raw data is accessed from [ODDS library](https://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/) and [ADBench](https://github.com/Minqi824/ADBench) and preprocessed using [data_preprocess.py](../data_preprocess.py).
_celeba_, _cover_, _campaign_, _fraud_, and _census_ are too large, and can be accessed and processed offline.
